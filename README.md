## What is MINE?

MINE stands for **MINE Is Not Enterprise**.

It is intentionally designed as a lightweight, clean, non-enterprise storage management platform.

MINE will never aim to become an enterprise product.
However, it is licensed under MIT to ensure anyone is free to fork, extend, or commercialize it under their own terms.


---

## 🏗 Architecture

MINE follows Clean Architecture principles and is organized into distinct layers:

* **Domain contracts** (`mine-spec`)
* **Infrastructure adapters** (e.g., MinIO)
* **Backend service (this repository)**
* **Frontend dashboard (in progress)**

The backend depends only on abstract contracts and remains provider-agnostic.

---

## 📦 Current Status

At the moment, this repository contains:

* ✅ Backend service
* 🚧 Frontend (in development)

The frontend dashboard is being developed separately and will provide a user interface for storage management.

---

## 🔌 Supported Providers

Support is implemented through adapters.

Currently:

* MinIO (via `mine-adapter-minio`)

Planned:

* AWS S3
* Azure Blob Storage
* Other S3-compatible providers

---

## 🎯 Design Goals

* Provider abstraction
* Strong typing
* Clean separation of concerns
* Explicit error translation
* Minimal infrastructure leakage
* Multi-provider readiness
* Extensibility without tight coupling

---

## 🧱 Project Ecosystem

MINE is composed of multiple repositories:

* `mine-spec` → Domain contracts (MIT)
* `mine-adapter-minio` → MinIO adapter (AGPL-3.0-only)
* `mine` → Backend service (this repository)
* Frontend dashboard (in progress)

If você quiser, posso:

* Ajustar o tom (mais técnico, mais minimalista ou mais “open source community”)
* Escrever uma versão mais enxuta
* Ou estruturar um README ainda mais arquitetural (com diagramas e seções técnicas mais profundas)

Qual estilo você quer que o MINE transmita?
